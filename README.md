# Customised version of smart-counter Dashboard 
** Only tested so far in Dutch counters **

The adaption and revamping of (parts of) the Python code were done for learning purposes.

Further adaptions to Dashboard were done for the sake of clarity, and trying to depict the most relevant information 
IMO.
